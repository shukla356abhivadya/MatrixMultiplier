# MatrixMultiplier
This code performs matrix multiplication between two user-provided matrices. Here's a concise description:

1.Input Dimensions: The user specifies the dimensions (rows and columns) of the two matrices.
2.Validation: It checks whether the matrices can be multiplied by ensuring that the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix. If not, the program exits.
3.Input Matrices: The user enters the elements of both matrices.
4.Matrix Multiplication: Using nested loops, the program computes the product of the two matrices by calculating the dot product for each element in the resultant matrix.
5.Result Display: The program prints the resultant matrix in a readable format.
